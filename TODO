blog needs to update (live vs. periodically)
  upon update, process database for articles to display
  update recently published pages with new editorials?
  flag articles with whether or not they've been published

  daily cleaning (can be implemented post-hackathon)
    query for an delete outdated articles
  
  updates with more recent news (can also be implemented post-hackathon hehe)
    RSS feeds will continuously fetch new editorials
    
  database contains:
    article url -> timestamp, sentiment, whether article has been displayed

Set up and figure out how to efficiently query database to construct a post
 
IDOL OnDemand:
  given editorials, run topic/entity extraction
    for topics with sufficiently high discussion, run sentiment analysis
  or just run sentiment analysis

Reach:
  incorporate comments from reddit, twitter, and other social sites (idk any more)

Optimizations:
  do initial filtering based on article title only, then process the full text
